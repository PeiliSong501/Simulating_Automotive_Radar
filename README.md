## Overview

This project focuses on simulating automotive radar signals (pitch, yaw, range, velocity, reflectivity) by leveraging multimodal sensor inputs, including **LiDAR** and **camera data**.  
The simulator is designed to model radar observations in complex driving environments and serves as a research tool for perception, sensor fusion, and learning-based radar understanding.

## Code Status

⚠️ **Important Notice**

Since I am extremely busy these days, the current version of this repository:

- is **not well organized**
- contains **comments of poor quality**
- may have **suboptimal code readability**

The code is released **as-is** to support reproducibility of the paper results.

## Future Updates

A **cleaned and refactored version** of the codebase will be released in the future, including:

- clearer project structure
- detailed code comments
- usage instructions and examples
- configuration explanations

✉️ If you have urgent questions or require clarification for reproduction purposes, feel free to contact the author via email: **your_email@domain.com**

Please stay tuned for updates.
